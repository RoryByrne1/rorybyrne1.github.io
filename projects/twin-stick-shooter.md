description: Computer Science A Level NEA
---

In Computer Science A-Level, every student is required to do an Non-Exam Assessment (NEA). This is a coursework that *'allows students to develop their practical skills in the context of solving a realistic problem or carrying out an investigation'*, by choosing a problem or investigation to solve

The problem I chose was that my made-up friend really missed playing video games with his other made-up friends, and none of the games around now could satisfy them (an excuse to make a game).

<a href="/assets/Computer%20Science%20NEA.pdf" target="_blank">Here</a> is my 250 page design document detailing the process and code of my NEA.

My NEA recieved a mark of 73/75.

I made all the art myself using Aseprite (although everything was 8x8 pixel art, a choice I made partially because I thought it looked good and mostly because it would be easier to draw)

with no help from AI of any sort (I didn't know much about it at the time)

I also created some of the sound effects myself, using the MIDI application FamiTracker
programming all myself

UI

no AI
