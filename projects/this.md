I built this website from scratch using Jekyll and custom HTML, CSS, and Liquid templates. This site is open source and hosted on GitHub pages, the code can be found <a href="https://github.com/RoryByrne1/rorybyrne1.github.io" target="_blank" aria-label="GitHub">here</a>. All content, design, and code were created and are maintained by me.

This site is a constant work in progress.
