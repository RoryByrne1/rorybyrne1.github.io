this site will become my portfolio

## how the site works

there are multiple pages and types of pages
- home
- project
- devlogs
- devlog

the **home** page gives an overview of me 
it includes links to each project and other relevant links
a **project** page gives an overview of a project
it will include a link to the project's devlogs page if the project has one
a **devlogs** page shows all devlogs (in reverse chronological order) of this project
clicking on one will direct to its devlog page
a **devlog** page shows a single devlog
