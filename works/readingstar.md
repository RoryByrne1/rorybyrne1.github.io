ReadingStar 2.0 is a work in progress offline AI-powered educational app using music to support speech development for autistic children, developed as part of the UCL Industry Exchange Network programme alongside my teammates Doruk Ersoy, Sinan Sensurucu, and Marko Stefanov. It is in collaboration with Intel, IBM, the National Autistic Society, and MotionInput Games.

I do not usually endorse the use of AI to create music, however, this is solely for educational purposes and not commercial use.

The original version of ReadingStar was an app that allowed users to enter YouTube URLs to extract captions and sing along, giving a score for how well you did. It was about to be released for free on the Microsoft Store before YouTube removed the caption API, breaking the app.
