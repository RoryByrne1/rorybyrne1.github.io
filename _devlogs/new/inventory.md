My idea for the inventory system is that the player starts only with 2 hands. Each hand can hold one item and you can throw the item from either hand (two separate buttons). Some things require both hands (e.g. logs, fallen trees, an axe), and you have to throw with both hands (both buttons at the same time). Then, you eventually will get upgrades to this. You could get a bindle for your smaller fuel types (sticks, wood cuts) that you can put on your back. You could get a tool belt that holds your tools so you don't have to drop them every time (your axe, your building tool, your saw, torch, lantern, hatchet)
hatchet is quicker but less powerful


wood piles
can be found everywhere (on wheelbarrows, on the fire, where you put your logs, when chopping logs into smaller pieces two log piles are formed on either side)
when you drop or throw fuel on the floor it starts a wood pile, when you throw or drop fuel nearby it joins the wood pile
