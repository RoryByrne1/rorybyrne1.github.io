It has been a busy term at university and I have not opened this project since early August. But I have been thinking.

First of all, I am going to start again and start with Unity. I liked Godot, especially for it being lightweight, but I want to learn the industry standard engine.

more interesting wood:
- twigs / kindling
- split logs, becomes default fuel, produces charcoal
- dampness on wood, longer burn, more smoke, less heat
- pinecones, quick flare, short duration
- resiny wood
- peat, late game (shovel to dig peat blocks)
- charcoal
need to use a variety of fuels for different things
fuels can have different sizes? either discrete or continuous
bigger trees take longer to cut down but result in bigger logs that burn for longer
kicking / throwing things at trees knocks down (/throws) sticks

weather:
- wind, shifts directions, need to shield it with rocks
- rain, differing levels, dampens all wood
- fog, reduces visibility

rain:
- need to be there to shield it? with your cloak? 
- protect your wood piles from getting damp
- also has benefits afterwards, certain fuels or items become available

gathering fuel:
- better fuel further out but
    - risk getting lost
    - missing a sudden weather change

game loop:
- start with making and protecting a good fire
- get it big and good and protected from sudden weather changes
- then you can go further out, find upgrades and new tools
- rain is still big risk, can hear clouds rolling in
- improve fire defenses, can go further

fire:
- smoke
- heat
- light
- size

fuel:
- ignition delay / multiplier for unlit -> burning
- burn time / multiplier for burning -> burnt
- smokiness
- heat output
- light output
- size contribution
- mass
- wetness
- effect of wetness
burning is a curve (smoke, heat, light output are curves)
maybe this curve is from mass, unlit mass / burning mass / burnt mass
all fuel starts as just unlit mass
put it in the fire, unlit mass -> burning mass
burning mass slowly becomes burnt mass (or some disappears, some into burnt mass)
output is determined from amount of burning mass (multipliers)
can retrieve burn mass as ashes / charcoal? or need to clear away ashes and charcoal
can reuse charcoal, good in rain
burnt mass takes space, reduces airflow
need to stockpile different wood types and plan their usages
heat dries nearby fuels
pre-ignition requirements? small fire can only burn twigs and kindling? visual levels to the fire


goals:
- fire is a ritual / promise?
    - promised to keep it lit
    - tradition, mourning fire
- fire is safe zone
    - keeps scary things out, gathering at night is risky
    - (when you finally get torch you can explore at night)
    - need to sleep there (you get tired and can't move as quickly)
- need to make a signal
    - lookout will scan the forest at dawn or something
    - fire needs to be big enough on the last day
maybe sometimes you want a small fire
- FIRE TO KEEP OUT COLD
    - of course
    - can only explore as long as you don't freeze
    - bigger fire, bigger warmth radius / warmth meter, longer and further expeditions
    - better fuel is further out
    - movement and forces stiffen as you get colder
    - torches?
        - allows you to take fire with you but doesn't last for very long
        - bigger fire bigger torches?
    - failure is soft and recoverable

sleeping?
- can only sleep by the fire
- fire burns whilst sleeping
- day cycle is checkpoints
    - the game saves every morning
    - you can go back to old checkpoints (also when you freeze)
- maybe not mandatory or at least very flexible
    - shouldn't be frustrating but good sleep should reward you
    - you have to trust the fire to last whilst you sleep
    - wake up if fire is dying / too cold
- offers a bit of calm
    - other restful things too?
        - toast marshmallows
        - knit (warm clothes keep warm for longer)
        - play music


player movement:
- acceleration and deceleration
- carrying heavy fuels slow acceleration
- wet ground reduces friction
- wind pushes a little
- can kick fuel? when both hands full, can kick twigs / pinecones / logs into fire
- can push fuel by moving into it, kick gives it a short force
    - fuel has one move function? vector and force as input? or maybe multiple

throwing fuel:
- only physics on throwing
- bouncing and rolling and randomness (pinecones are unpredictable)
- fire pit is very generous
- wind pushes a little
- fuel thrown could scatter ash or other fuels?
- right click only?
    - tap to drop
    - hold down to throw
    - (increasing force variable)

inventory:
- two hands
- each hand can hold one fuel item
- heavy items require both hands
- upgrades
    - can hold some heavy items in one hand
    - backpack / pouch can hold lots of twigs / one log
    - wheelbarrow, can push / move, can move around lots of logs
    - crates / barrels, can store dry piles, can push
    - upgrade fire pits
    - boots to reduce weight deceleration
    - gloves to carry more in one hand, more power in throws
    - tool sling
    - eventually automation
- primary hand?
    - throw does primary hand first, then secondary
    - secondary if primary is empty
    - can swap which hand is primary / selected (with q or something)
    - nothing if both are empty
    - pick up into non-primary first


- log piles
    - every log has a radius of collection around it
    - when you throw / kick another log into its radius it connects to start a pile
    - all logs entering the radius with zPosition lower than 0.05 or something
    - when it reaches max, new piles formed next to it
- can chop other logs by dropping / throwing them onto a splitting stump or something
    - all logs entering the radius with zPosition between 0.1 and 0.2 or something
    - hit with axe and splits into 2 halves
    - initiate a throw onto both sides forming 2 piles

- floor has a friction level and an absorption level
    - absorbs a percentage of energy from the log and reflects, restitution maybe
    - bounces
    - e = speed after / speed before
    - friction on horizontal motion (probably just same e value on all velocities)


- enemies / animals / threats
    - throw things at them! of course!
    - throwing is the main mechanic i suppose
    - throw rocks and pebbles at them
    - can get an upgrade to store a pebble pouch
    - can break rocks into pebbles with pickaxe maybe


realise you've been making the fire for a bad reason / person

this isn't my dream game or anything, just a fun project
