# jewellery

in maybe november or december of 2022 i started making rings out of my old guitar strings

since then i have made rings, bracelets, and necklaces

i use my own and my friends' old strings and then solder them to hold them in place

i make these for myself and for my favourite people

below is a gallery of some of the ones i remembered to take pictures of

i'm not sure why i liked taking pictures with that rock

<div class="gallery">
  {% assign tiles = page.list | sort: "date" | reverse %}
  {% for tile in tiles %}
    <div class="gallery-tile">
      <img src="{{ tile.image }}" alt="{{ tile.description }}" class="tile-cover">
      <strong class="gallery-date">{{ tile.dated }}</strong><br>
      <span>{{ tile.description }}</span>
    </div>
  {% endfor %}
</div>
