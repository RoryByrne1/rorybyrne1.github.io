# video games

being raised with 3 older brothers i played a lot of video games growing up

i don't play very many games now and mostly only play games with other people but i do love the ones i play

below is a list of my favourite games

<div class="image-tiles">
    {% assign tiles = page.list | sort: "year" | reverse %}
    {% for tile in tiles %}
        <div class="image-tile">
        <div class="tile-card">
            <img src="{{ tile.image }}" alt="{{ tile.title }} cover" class="tile-cover">
            <div class="tile-info">
            <strong>{{ tile.title }}</strong><br>
            <span>{{ tile.creator }}</span>
            <span>{{ tile.year }}</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        </div>
    {% endfor %}
</div>

<div class="small-text">game art copyright belongs to the respective creators/publishers</div>

one day i'd like to make a game myself
