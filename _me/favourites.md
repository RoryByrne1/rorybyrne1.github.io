I talk a lot about favourites on this page.
It turns out my favourite things tend to be my favourite people's favourite things. All my music taste I owe to my siblings, my favourite flower is my sister's favourite flower, my favourite bird is my brother's favourite bird, sometimes I feel like I owe my whole personality to all these people. A amalgamation of the people I love
What I don't know if that is me associating those things with those people or if that is just coincidence or something else
