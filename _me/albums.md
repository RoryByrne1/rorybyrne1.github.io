there are many more albums i love but these are the ones that inspire me most
they inspire me in ways more than just musically and they've all been important to me at different points throughout my life


one day I aspire to make an album myself
though i have limited experience in music creation, made one piece (that i am in fact pretty proud of) for GCSE music when I was 15 and other than that occasionally play around on the guitar
It's very naive of me, and the artists of these albums are incredibly experienced and gifted, it is crazy to think I could create something even remotely good, but there's still that desire in me to make something cool that other people like, and I think I also desperately want to prove to people that I can do something cool, it's also naive to think it would help with that

my music taste is a lot from my siblings and these albums tend to also be the favourite albums of my siblings
i find that a lot with my 'favourite' things, they tend to be the favourite things of other people, maybe my favourite people
