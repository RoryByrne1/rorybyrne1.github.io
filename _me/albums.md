There are many more albums that I love but these are the ones that inspire me most, inspiring me in ways more than just musically.

I mostly owe my music taste to my siblings, they raised me with a lot of these albums in the car, show me new music, and bring me to concerts. These albums tend to be their favourite albums too. I do find that my favourite things tend to be the favourite things of my favourite people, my favourite flower is my sister's favourite flower, my favourite bird is my brother's favourite bird, sometimes I feel like I owe my whole personality to all these people.

I aspire to one day create an album myself. I've lightly dabbled in music composition but it is very naive of me and I know this but there's a desire in me to make something cool that is hard to ignore. I think I also desperately want to prove to people that I can do something cool, it's also naive to think it would help with that
