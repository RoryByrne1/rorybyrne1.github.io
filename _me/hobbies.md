I play and listen to a lot of music. I've been playing piano and guitar since I was 9, more recently starting to play bass and drums as well.

I make jewellery (mostly rings) out of old guitar strings and give them to my favourite people.

I really enjoy cooking, especially cooking for other people.

I sometimes take pictures.

I play badminton and occasionally run.
