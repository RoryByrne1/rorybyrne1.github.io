I play and listen to a lot of music. I've been playing piano and guitar since I was 9, more recently starting to play bass and drums as well.

I make jewellery out of used guitar strings for me and for my favourite people.

I enjoy cooking, especially when I get to do it for other people.

I like to take pictures.

I play badminton and occasionally run.
