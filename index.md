# about me

<img width=250 src="/assets/rory2.JPG" class="image">

My name is Rory Byrne and I was born in Oxfordshire in 2006.
I'm a first year student at UCL studying Computer Science.



Playing and listening to music are very important to me; I've been playing guitar since I was 9 and piano my whole life, more recently starting to play bass and drums as well. Aside from this, I love cooking, playing badminton, making jewellery, and taking pictures.
